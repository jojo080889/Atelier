<strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>  By registering on Atelier, you are invited to participate in a research study on your experience with Atelier. The purpose of this study to evaluate whether or not Atelier meets the needs of artists that want to teach and learn from each other online. The projects, critiques, and other social behavior on the Atelier site only will be logged for research purposes. These logs will be analyzed to create quantitative summaries of behavior on the site (e.g. the typical number of critiques written by a user, how often projects are posted, etc.) as well as to characterize the behavior of users on Atelier (e.g. analyzing the types of critiques or projects posted by mentees). These logs will be stored in password-protected servers and will be accessible only by the research team. To help spark participation on the site, art prompts will be provided once a week to help the community come up with ideas for projects to post on the site.
</p>
<p>
At the end of your participation, you may be asked to answer questions regarding the benefits and drawbacks of Atelier on finding both mentors and mentees, the effect of a mentoring relationship on your own growth as an artist, what you look for in a mentoring relationship, and the motivations that lie behind looking for such a relationship. The interviews will be conducted through voice-only Skype calls and will be recorded. If a Skype call is not possible or preferable, you may opt to be interviewed via chat instead, and transcripts of the chat will be recorded. Recordings will be transcribed and analyzed and then will be stored in password-protected servers and will be accessible only by the research team. Your interviews will be analyzed in conjunction with your usage activity on the Atelier site (such as posting art projects, critiquing, and liking). If asked for an interview, you may choose to refuse with no penalty.
</p>
<p>
<strong>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</strong>  The time involvement for participating in this study is 4 weeks. One art prompt will be provided per week. However, the time actually spent on the Atelier website is up to you. As long as you complete a response to each art prompt, you are not obligated to spend any certain amount of time on Atelier and are free to spend as much or as little time participating on the site as you wish. If you asked for an interview, the interview will take approximately 30 to 60 minutes.
